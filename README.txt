The following steps will guide you to execute the files that are contained in this folder.

FOR PROBLEM 1A TO PROBLEM 3B
1.Copy this entire folder on your Desktop.
2.In each folder containing a main_filename.cpp file, copy the image, which you want to give as an input, to that particular file 
3.Now open Terminal
4.Give the path of main_filename.cpp file for each problem that you want to run.
5.For example: problem_2A has two parts in it namely part_A and PART_B.Each of these folders contain a separate main_filename.cpp files.
Now if you want to run main_histogram_equalization_transfer.cpp,
then in terminal type the following after the $ sign:
cd ./Desktop/EE569_hw1_6914970827_Kulkarni/Problem_2A/part_A
Then type the following:
make
The code will ask you to enter your files.Please do so accordingly with the help of the example that gets displayed in terminal.
6.So after you reach the main_filename.cpp and type make, you also need to give the required file names as will be shown in an example when you type make.
7.Now, the output files that get generated after the execution of this code will get stored in the same folder as that of your current main_filename.cpp.
8.You can then view these files,which are raw images, by using ImageJ software.
9.Repeat these steps for Problem 1A to problem 3B


FOR PROBLEM 3C
1.Give the path of the main_filename.cpp as described above.
2.Then type make.
3.Now 3 files will get automatically generated in the same folder.
4.Copy these 3 files along with the BM3D_code.m file into matlab.
5.Save it in a new folder and then run the file.
6. An image will get displayed.
